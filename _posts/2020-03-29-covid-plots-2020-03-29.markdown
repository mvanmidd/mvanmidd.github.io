Updates: Refactored to use https://coronadatascraper.com/#home , just in time for them to 
encounter a data fusion bug that wiped out their deaths counts for most states. 
It seems like they are focusing on building data fusion infrastructure for the long term,
which is great, but they're not treating this like a fire and it might not get fixed
today.

In the mean time, even the coronadatascraper.com folks are recommending that people use
https://covidtracking.com/api/ for US data. CDS.com seems to still be OK for international.

I'm not looking forward to yet another data source swap (this would be data source #4).
Hopefully the CDS.com folks get it together.

Another option is the NYT data: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/commits/master. 
However, they haven't committed to a predictable update frequency
 ([I asked](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/issues/41)). They seem to be publishing
 daily, so if that keeps up, maybe I'll switch.
 
 In the mean time, today's graphs are a little wonky.
