Testing the markdown features. Here's the example that Jekyll gives:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

And here's an example of standard triple backtick:

```python
def hello_blog():
    print("Sup")
hello_blog()
#=> Prints some stuff, for sure

```
